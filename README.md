Our final proposal is to create a website that contains the data of soccer teams, including leagues, players, matches, stats and much more. Currently we are using a databse that contains previous data, but we might change the databse we are using to one that is more current.

/players/:id

takes the id of the player and returns the data of that player

/team/:id

takes the id of the team and returns the data of that team

/country/:id

takes the id of the country and returns the data of that country

/league/:id

takes the id of the league and returns the data of that league

For future endpoints, we will probably arrange the individual data of players to be more organized. We also are going probably going to have a "home" type of page for teams instead of just the /team endpoint, possibly changing the catalog for leagues too.
